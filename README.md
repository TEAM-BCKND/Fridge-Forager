## Software Requirements

### Vision

Fridge Forager is an application where a user can input what ingredients they have available to them. Once entered, using various APIs, the user will receive feedback which displays the available recipes. The biggest pain point this project is solving is to help people not waste food and give them ideas on new recipes they'll discover on the app. It also solves the problem of an individual not knowing what to make with what ingredients they have available. This product will help people manage their ingredients and inspire them to make new recipes and give them ideas on new recipes they'll discover on the app.
